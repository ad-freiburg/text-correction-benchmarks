This means that their graphs can be identified, and the length ascribed to corresponding edges is the same.
Energy distributions are dominated at low angles by a peak close to the beam energy, while the amplitude and energy mean value of the peak decrease when the angle of emission increases. The production of low energy particles increases with the target charge and mass. These observations indicate that most of the emitted particles result from the projectile fragmentation during nuclear reactions.
In Section 5, we have shown that the density matrix of spin state determines the probability distribution function

This is a rather strong property, but in particular, every group is reductive.
Now we turn to discussion of more realistic situation, when many pair interaction scatterers are present in the sample. It is worth noting that in our mean-field treatment we neglect OP phase, which is a strongly fluctuating quantity in short coherence length high-Tc superconductors and, especially, in the inhomogeneous situation. In the present paper we only study local pairing and do not concern the global transition temperature Tc , which is controlled by the phase fluctuations.

We present the energy per nucleon as a function of the density at various temperatures in Fig. 3 . As the temperature increases the nuclear matter becomes less bound and the the saturation curve around the equilibrium point in the ZM models is flatter than that in the Walecka model. This indicates that the nuclear matter EOS in ZM models is softer compared to the obtained in the Walecka Model, even at finite temperature. We can also conclude that the incompressibility of nuclear matter decreases when the temperature increases. This can be seen more clearly in Fig. 4 where we show the pressure-density isotherms of nuclear matter at different temperatures. Since the incompressibility K is related to ‚àÇp/‚àÇœÅ (calculated at the equilibrium point where the pressure vanishes), we see directly that when the temperature increases K decreases, and among the ZM models, the ZM3 model always gives the softest EOS for a fixed temperature.

Non-archimedean setup
In preview of the paper layout, we begin by introducing the reaction-diffusion equations that we will use as the drive system. We discuss how this system is solved numerically and the parameters used to simulate complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Next, we implement the response system and show the parameter PDEs used to find autosynchronization. We demonstrate the power of the systems of PDEs to autosynchronize by employing three different spatial functions for the parameters. Next, we show the estimated parameters and the convergence plots for both state variables and parameters to the correct values. Finally, we give an improvement on the response system that admits autosynchronization wherein only one species is sampled, which is an important breakthrough for applications since generally only the phytoplankton is easily observable.

In summary, while the arguments are admittedly vague and they do involve a certain level of guess, trial and error, the presented parametrization offers a good chance that with further restrictions on the parameters a two-spin interaction Hamiltonian can be obtained. As will be seen shortly, five conditions are imposed so that the resulting Hamiltonian depends on three (real) parameters.

One approach to porting a component to run on a GPU is to identify the entry and exit points of that component, copy all required data to the GPU beforehand, and copy it back after the GPU computation.

The ideas contained in this paper were presented at a round table with the same title on April 12th , 2012, during the European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research at the University of Vienna, Austria. The guided reflection on the challenges and opportunities of cybernetics and systems research (CSR) included initial interventions by panelists Peter Erdi, Helena Knyazeva, Stefan Thurner, Peter Csermely, and Alexander Laszlo. Afterwards, the floor was opened to interventions from the general public and further interventions by panelists.

We also note a false positive (a pedestrian being detected as anomaly) in the last image of column (b). Upon further investigation, this false positive was due to the fact that the cells in the region of the pedestrian had minimal or no activity during the training phase. Consequently any foreground object entering this zone during testing was considered as anomalous, irrespective of the observed features.

is excluded, planar coordinates are interesting in physics. In its early stage, the universe is generally believed to be through a phase of inflation, which can be described by a de Sitter spacetime in planar coordinates. On the other hand, recent cosmological observations indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, so the future of our universe may well be again described by a de Sitter spacetime in these coordinates. In this section, it will be used to study the positive mass theorem for P-asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes in a mathematically rigorous and complete way.

Integrating out the mediators at the scale Œõ generates what we call SMœá EFT, containing only œá and the whole SM field content as its degrees of freedom. Many explicit realizations for LUV exist in the literature, and they can all be matched onto the SMœá EFT at the cutoff scale Œõ. The regime of validity of this EFT extends all the way down to the EWSB scale, where the heavy EW states (W , Z, h and t-quark) have to be integrated out and the residual gauge symmetry is SU (3)c √ó U (1)em . For this reason we employ a different EFT below the EWSB scale, with only a SU (3)c √ó U (1)em gauge symmetry and 5 quark flavors, which we call EMSMœá EFT (where EMSM stands for SM with only electromagnetic interactions). In the remaining part of this Section we give a basis of independent operators for both EFTs up to mass dimension 6, as well as a prescription for how to match SMœá EFT onto EMSMœá EFT at the EWSB scale.

An unquenched result
Each test-job started in the sp-system is typically assigned a unique ID, and all scripts and input files used in the test as well as all output files are kept. This allows the validation of all versions against each other and ensures reproducibility of previous results. In addition to this unique ID, validation jobs may be tagged with a description, indicating which software versions were used, and the Unix time stamp of the execution to aid the bookkeeping. Script-based web pages are used to record and display available validation runs for a given description and indicate the status of the compilation for the individual packages or tests within table cells, which are linked to a corresponding output file. This file may be a simple yes/no, a text file, a histogram, a root file or even a link to a further page, depending on the nature of the test.
Hadronic processes
This technique is not appropriate at the lower frequencies in the range of 10 MHz, because the size of the cavity, which is determined by the wavelength of the oscillating field, becomes impracticable. But, going back to the bases of the interaction between the gamma ray photon and the nucleus, mediated by an external applied field, we see that all that is necessary for the interaction mediated by the magnetic sublevels is the presence of a magnetic field H2 , oscillating with the frequency œâ2 . Currents oscillating in conductors create such magnetic fields, which are not electromagnetic waves. We have in fact an LC circuit, and, if we assume the volume of the capacitor and of the inductor to be comparable, then the amplitude of the magnetic field in the inductor is comparable (in CGS units) to the amplitude of the electric field in the capacitor. A magnetic field of 100 Gauss corresponds to an electric field of 100 statvolt/cm, or 30 kV/cm. The energy periodically transferred between the inductor and capacitor is H 2 /8œÄ erg/cm3 . Assuming H=100 Gauss, a volume of 102 cm3 , and a Q-factor of the LC circuit of 100, the input power in the circuit is, at a frequency of 100 MHz, of about 1 kW. The equivalent energy flux Œ¶2 corresponding to the field H2 of 100 Gauss is of about 106 W/cm2 .

The resolution of Models B and C is a factor of two lower, i.e. 256 √ó 256 √ó 256. However, this does not appear to affect the comparison; similar behaviour is observed and the jet is adequately resolved with 10 resolution elements across its diameter. We do not expect the much more uniform density distribution in model C to suffer from lower resolution.

We have presented a new tool, ScannerS, devoted to the search for global minima in multi-Higgs models. In this work we have applied it to some versions of a simple extension of the SM - the addition of a complex singlet to the SM doublet, with some symmetries. The code includes the most relevant theoretical and experimental bounds. Our main focus is in distinguishing the possible phases of each model by using the present experimental data both from the LHC and from dark matter experiments.

The acceleration of coordinate axes that are fixed in the laboratory frame, relative to the observer co-moving with the test particle, is simply the opposite of the test particle acceleration, since the laboratory frame is non-accelerating. Similarly, the relative velocity to the same observer of an object fixed in the laboratory frame is the opposite of the test particle velocity as observed from the laboratory frame. This results in an angular velocity of Thomas precession of the laboratory frame coordinate axes seen by the test particle co-moving observer of

where the brackets indicate a certain way of averaging. This averaging is here done only perpendicular to the magnetic field and in the time domain. Averaging over a long time scale corresponds to structures with low frequency and averaging over short time scales corresponds to higher frequencies. The same is true in the spatial domain.
Under these assumptions, we have the following.
A new SKA Science Working Group structure was implemented in the beginning of 2013. The SKA Science Working Group is led by the SKA Science Director. Working under the Science Director are the SKA Project Scientist(s) and Deputy Project Scientist. Also in the Science Working Group are regional project scientists and a delegate or chair from each of the Science Teams. There are currently eight Science Teams, covering: i) Pulsars for Fundamental Physics, ii) Epoch of Reionization and the Dark Ages, iii) H I Surveys for Galaxy Evolution, iv) Continuum Surveys, v) Cosmology, vi) Cradle of Life / Astrobiology, vii) Cosmic Magnetic Fields, and viii) Transients. The Science Working Group (SWG) consists of the key science personnel and coordinate the work of the Science Teams. The Science Teams represent the broader community and thus can have a much larger membership. They are expected to: 1) provide guidance to the SKA Organisation / SWG on the science drivers from each respective area, 2) Provide assistance in developing technical requirements from the science goals and requirements, and 3) Serve as SKA liaisons to the broader community. Science Team membership, a responsibility of the Science Team chair(s), is open to any researcher with a science interest in the SKA and a willingness to contribute an appropriate level of effort toward SKA science needs.

Clearly, this simple Newtonian system has no direct relation with glassy systems. Nevertheless, it might be possible that there exists a variable representing the time correlation function for a glassy system that obeys an equation similar to that in the example discussed above. Such a variable would provide a characterization of the non-ergodic transition in that glassy system. Beginning from this speculation, in this paper, we determine such a variable and derive its evolution equation from a many-body Langevin model, employing several assumptions. We demonstrate that the obtained equation indeed does exhibit a non-ergodic transition.

Introduction
In conclusion, we have studied the behavior of quasi bound states in a bi-ripple waveguide as the distance between the two ripple cavities changes. We found that the widths and positions of the resonances associated with the quasi bound state poles change in a sinusoidal way with variation of the distance between the ripple cavities. In 2D and 3D models of the Dicke effect, the coupling parameter decays when the distance between two atoms (impurities or quantum dots) is longer than the wavelength of photon or electron. In the ripple waveguide system, the coupling parameter does not decay because the waveguide is a quasi 1-D system. We also studied the trajectories of S-matrix poles in the complex energy plane. We found that the pair of poles that give rise to the super- and subradiant resonances in the electron transmission, rotate on a circle centered on the S-matrix pole for the waveguide with a single cavity and are phase shifted by œÄ . Therefore, superradiant and subradiant resonances appear in oscillatory manner as the distance between cavities is changed. Furthermore, as the S-matrix poles rotate, the symmetry of the electron state associated with the superradiant (subradiant) resonance alternates between symmetric and anti-symmetric with increasing distance between the two ripple cavities.
We have showed predictions for direct photon production process in association with a heavy quark jet. Based on the discrepancy between data and theory at NLO at the Tevatron, we focused on the case of a charm jet because the charm intrinsic contribution is less suppressed in comparison to a possible bottom quark intrinsic contribution. We have shown that using the studied process, one can test models of intrinsic charm such as the BPHS model which modify the charm PDF at large x beyond the reach of DIS measurements.

Then the data series is transformed to the Sanson-Flamsteed coordinate system to remove the geometrical distortions caused by the projection of the sphere to the disc.

The results showed the new model performed very well.

Abstract
with the multiplication rule,
In May 2012 the members of the SKA Organisation announced the outcome of the site selection process. They decided on a dual-site implementation to maximise the value of the investments made on both sites and to maintain an inclusive approach to the SKA. The agreement means that in Phase 1 Australia will host the low frequency aperture arrays (SKA1-Low, see Figure 1) and a survey instrument that incorporates the 36 ASKAP dishes and approximately 60 additional dishes with phased array feeds (SKA1-Survey). In Phase 1 South Africa the SKA will incorporate the 64 dish MeerKAT with about another 190 dishes equipped with sensitive single pixel feeds into a sensitive instrument called SKA1-Mid. All 3 telescopes will operate independently as part of a single SKA Observatory. In Phase 2 the dish array (Figure 1) in South Africa will be built out further, totalling about 3000 dishes and including stations in the partner African countries, delivering baselines as long as 3000 km. The low frequency aperture array will be expanded in Australia to the full SKA collecting area. In Phase 2 the dense, or mid-frequency, aperture array (Figure 1) will be built in South Africa, pending successful review of this technology as part of the SKA Advanced Instrumentation Programme (AIP).
In a different approach, one can try to find an additional physical principle that excludes all other transformation leaving the Fourier transformation as the unique one acceptable for quantum mechanics.

An asymmetry in this model is that multiple questions can receive the same answer, but multiple answers cannot hold for the same question (in the same position). This is a consequence of the requirement that P be a function. This restriction may be removed by making P a set-valued function, or multifunction, ranging over the power set of A. We might then distinguish positions in which multiple answers are assigned to single questions as those satisfying the condition

We also access the curvature strength of central shell focusing singularities. We find that gravitational collapse of a non self-similar higher dimensional spacetime gives rise to a naked strong-curvature shell-focusing singularity, providing an explicit counter-example to the CCH.

Many current and planned synoptic sky surveys image the same areas of sky repeatedly over many years. With the ability to directly measure position angle, separation and contrast ratio of individual binaries, in many cases sufficient data will be collected to follow the motion of binary systems with time. Since this can be done over large areas and very large samples, BinaryFinder could be used to obtain orbital measurements (and thus mass constraints) for a very large sample of binaries.

Some possible criticisms on the error budget
We first confirmed that the unreduced system would exhibit all types of chimeras predicted by our analysis, and that they would correspond to stable states, for various points in parameter space. These states were observed with both NœÉ = 20 and NœÉ = 200 oscillators per population. The observed behavior is that the system first goes through a tiny transient and reach an attracting state which was confirmed to be stable even for long computation times. The transient may be explained by the fact that the system, due to its finite size, can only be approximately on to the OA-manifold (or a member of the OA-family, as explained in the Discussion).

The period-luminosity (P-L) relations of long period variables on the AGB are well documented for the Large Magellanic Cloud. Observations have revealed not only that Mira variables follow a tight near-infrared P-L relation (Glass & Lloyd Evans 1981, 2003; Feast et al. 1989), but also that semiregular variables pulsating in overtone modes follow distinct and well-defined P-L relations (Wood et al. 1999, Wood 2000). In recent years, there has been strong interest in pulsating red giants, which is reflected in the increasing number of independent analyses of large photometric databases (Cioni et al. 2001, 2003, Noda et al. 2002, Lebzelter et al. 2002, Glass & Schultheis 2003, Kiss & Bedding 2003, Ita et al. 2003, Groenewegen 2004).

was applied to the Dopplergrams to enhance the p-mode oscillations above the other features. The temporal power spectrum was obtained for each pixel. This spectrum was smoothed by applying a digital filter, namely a Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter (Press et al., 1992), to the power spectrum. This filter basically smooths the data by a window function of a predefined number of data points and a polynomial order with a proper weighting and then finds the maximum of the smoothed spectrum. We observe an optimal fit with a window of 32 data points and a polynomial of order 6. The peak frequency of the smoothed spectrum was then determined by selecting the discrete frequency in the appropriate frequency domain whose ordinate was greatest in the smoothed spectrum.

The divergency of field and current density can lead to overheating and melting of narrow necks. If we assume that breakdown is determined by the critical density of heat emission Qc , all places where œÉF 2 > Qc will be overheated. It means that some number of overheated places occurs in any weak field F0 independently on the field strength. So the application of field irreversibly change the electrical properties of system. Moreover, the direction of field tends to the residual anisotropy of a system.

The sea effect arises, because the magnetic field in the quark determinant changes the relative weight of the gauge configurations, and is therefore equivalent to a reweighting in B. In general, reweighting is a technique that uses configurations generated at a given (starting) point of the parameter space, and assigns a new weight to each configuration, in a fashion that the resulting ensemble describes the system at a new (target) point of the parameter space. Thus, the expectation value of an arbitrary observable O at the target point is obtained in terms of measurements on the configurations generated at the starting point. Here, we will consider the B = 0 system as the starting point, and the B > 0 system as the target ensemble. For this case, the difference of weights equals the ratio of quark determinants at B and at B = 0, and the exact rewriting of the expectation value at B reads

It deserves to be mentioned at this point that, whereas the results in this paper on the existence of compatible representations of centralizer algebras of a normed algebra can, by passing to its completion, easily be derived from their versions for the centralizer algebras of a Banach algebra, this is no longer the case for our results on embeddings of centralizer algebras. The reason is simply that the centralizer algebras of a normed algebra may be strictly smaller than those of its Banach algebra completion. Thus our consideration of normed algebras rather than Banach algebras does not only make manifest that the factorization theorem is not needed, but it also avoids being unnecessarily restrictive as to the scope of the results.

Linearity vs. Nonlinearity in Sound Production
Note that this notation is compatible with that used in theorem 4.1.
A mask is used to mark or remove the zeroth order images. First the zeroth order sources in the grism image is matched to those in a broad band detection image. The sources are found with SExtractor (hereafter SE; Bertin & Arnouts, 1996) which is used to catalog the sources in both the detection and grism images. Only compact sources are matched. Their positions are used to define a linear transformation between the detection image and the zeroth order. The scaling ratio between the matched detection and zeroth order images is determined and used to model which pixels to mask. In the HDFN the the images in F775W and F850LP are typically 32 and 21 times brighter, respectively, in count rate than the zeroth order counterparts. This scaling ratio is used to determine which pixels will have zeroth order counterparts that are brighter than sky noise level. The position of these pixels in the detection image are transformed to populate a mask for the grism image which is then grown by three pixels to account for the slight dispersion in the zeroth order. Masked pixels are set to zero at the appropriate stage of the analysis.

Based on last season experience, the Collaboration expects to deploy up to 14 strings per season and complete IceCube in the 2010-11 season. Software development and physics analyses are ongoing and we expect first results very soon.
To study the thermodynamical variables of the distinguishable particle system, we consider two subsystems of particle number N1 , N2 , volumes V1 , V2 , energies E1 , E2 , respectively, in which their particles, volumes, and energies are allowed to be exchanged.

WIMPs may be captured, thermalized, and trapped using a combination of scattering in the core and in the crust. When a WIMP first nears a neutron star, gravity accelerates it to a high energy. These energetic WIMPs can scatter efficiently in the core because nucleon Pauli blocking plays less of a role. The energetic WIMP can easily excite nucleons above the Fermi sea so œÉW n ‚âà œÉ0 . However, energetic WIMPs can scatter at large q where the nuclear form factor F (q) ‚â™ 1. Therefore scattering in the crust may be inefficient for high energy WIMPs. Over time the WIMPs can loose energy by repeatedly scattering from nucleons in the core until the WIMPs have much lower energy. At that point Pauli blocking is important so scattering in the core becomes inefficient œÉW n ‚â™ œÉ0 . However low energy WIMPs can now scatter efficiently in the crust.
On a capital market the social group is formed from traders. Individual behaviour of agents is influenced by the need to associate with other agents and to obtain the approval of other agents in the group. Making decisions an individual equates own needs with those of the other agents from the group. Any two agents from the group may interact. The interaction consists of the exchange of information and it costs some money. We assume that agents interact in such a way that they give reference to the origin of the information if asked by other agents. Thus the agent may verify obtained private information. Hudak recently used methods described by Rivier to study social behaviour of such agents. He characterized the quantity which corresponds to verification of information. Here we study a capital market and social behaviour of agents relations. Quantity which characterizes verification of information contributes to an aversion of an agent with respect to a risk. The mix of investments of an agent in a given cell with an average measure A of risk aversion in the cell is found from minimum of the average per cell aim function < F M >. Absolute minimum corresponds to such a state in which there is an optimal mix of the exchange of information for a given expectations about the capital market. The crowd and personal /‚âà< f >/ contributions to the risk aversion of an agent are present in the aversion constant A. We have discussed a stable and metastable states of the market for different values of E, an expected return for a given investment period, of EV, an expected risk for a given investment period, and of b, a constant which characterizes contribution of the quantity < f > to the risk aversion. Characteristics of the variance of n for the distribution of nonreducibile subgroups are found. Our model describes intermediary process effects.

On 1 June 1998 the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, the Hon. Lionel Mtshali, announced in Parliament that the South African Government would fund 50 percent of the total cost of SALT, estimated as R100M (or US$20M at the time of the announcement), provided that the balance could be raised from international partners. The announcement was greeted with enthusiastic applause and the decision was strongly supported by all political parties.

Abstract We show how the method of separation of variables can be used to construct integrable models corresponding to curves describing vacuum structure of four-dimensional N = 2 SUSY Yang-Mills theories. We use this technique to construct models corresponding to SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with Nf < 2N matter hypermultiplets by generalising the periodic Toda lattice. We also show that some special cases of massive SU(3) gauge theory can be equivalently described by the generalisations of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top obtained via separation of variables.

In these experiments, we present several novel observations about the error surfaces of neural networks. We showed that paths through weight space are highly nonlinear, and that local minima (albeit good ones) are abundant. Further, we showed that even after symmetry is broken by random initialization, the error surfaces of neural networks appears to be highly non-convex. The stochasticity introduced by reshuffling data appears to be enough to diverge otherwise identical (and partially trained) networks towards different local minima. Further, we showed that regions of weight space with near 0 loss are not critical points, but large flat basins through which weights continue to travel as training continues.

During an inflationary epoch, quantum fluctuations swept up in the rapid expansion lead to perturbations in the present universe. A review of this mechanism, and of the modelling of an inflationary epoch, is given in Ref. 6. Inflation produces not only a spectrum of density perturbations, but also one of gravitational waves. These latter are capable of influencing large-angle microwave background anisotropies, as witnessed by the COBE satellite, and must be taken into account in a full comparison with observations.

In Folded SUSY, the low energy spectrum below the scale M contains, in addition to the SM states, the scalar partners of the top quark which couple just as the stop quarks would in typical SUSY models but carry no color quantum numbers. The cancellation of the Higgs mass UV sensitivity is ensured by a supersymmetry broken at the high scale M . The light scalar uncolored top partners, dubbed the f-stops, realize an accidental supersymmetry of the low energy spectrum below M . Above M the theory contains both colored and uncolored partners of the SM particles.

One should note that uncertainty in the outcome or measurement of an event is often not quantum-mechanical in origin. For example, even classically, the angle of elastic scattering of a given proton incident on a target is in practice not predictable, since it is not feasible to measure the position of the proton with respect to the scattering nucleus with sufficient precision to know the impact parameter. Thus even a classical analysis of the problem predicts only the scattering-angle distribution.

We continue by discussing the implications of this negative-delay phenomenon from a more general perspective. The pump-induced field effect can be a generic phenomenon for materials in which the photoexcited charge distribution gives rise to a macroscopic electric field. This would not be the case in metals, because excess charges are efficiently screened and the time-integrated Coulomb field effect is negligible. However, due to less efficient screening this field effect may be substantial for a wide variety of semiconductors including the recently discovered topological insulators. Our work defines a general framework to disentangle the intrinsic electron dynamics from the long-range field effect in trARPES experiments.

An error of 0.87% on MNIST is probably (at this time) state-of-the-art for the above learning setting. The only difference between softmax and DLSVM is the last layer. This experiment is mainly to demonstrate the effectiveness of the last linear SVM layer vs. the softmax, we have not exhaustively explored other commonly used tricks such as Dropout, weight constraints, hidden unit sparsity, adding more hidden layers and increasing the layer size.
This is often how Bell inequalities are stated; all the Bell inequalities are obtained by considering an arbitrary linear combination of correlations and then saying that this must be less than the maximum possible value of those correlations under extremal local realistic predictions.

By assuming some condition on |H|2 , we can further prove the following result,
The number of calculations required to find the electrostatic energy by direct planewise summation is proportional to N2 . An additional disadvantage of the direct planewise method is the conditional convergence of the lattice sums, leading to a dependence of the total energy on the choice of the planes in the crystal and inconsistency with periodic boundary conditions when the dipole moment of the unit cell is nonzero.

Simplifying the result
The outcome of these instructions is a sequence of random strings, all of them in order of length. Suppose the length of this new program is L symbols, this program will eventually print a random string of L + 1 symbols. But then we have just printed a random sequence of L + 1 symbols with less than L+1 symbols! This contradicts the definition of algorithmic randomness, therefore there cannot exist an algorithm that can decide the randomness of a string.

Our proposal consists of eliciting each subject to simulate the arousal of Yerkes-Dodson Law. To explore all the stress possibilities, our method is based two different test: one of visual attention and another of logical reasoning. Each individual starts in a comfort situation, continuing with an alertness and optimal performance state, and finishing with an anxiety and breakdown condition. If we go across the obtainedresults, its calibrates each individual performance because we have all the possible arousal points. Therefore we only have to make a relation with the achievement performance.

On the other hand, in an expanding universe with scale factor a(t) (t is the cosmological time), Œõ is a constant, while the matter density œÅm falls with a3 . Therefore, it is an important problem to understand why the observed matter density is so close to the vacuum energy density. This second question is usually referred to as the cosmic coincidence problem.

Robustness of bipartite Gaussian entangled beams propagating in lossy channels
Repeated similar calculations of factorial arguments can be avoided by noting that the factors (and denominators) of each successive term in the sum depend on the summation index k in such a way that they always change their argument by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, factorial arguments (table addresses) can be calculated before the sum loop. In the actual loop these addresses are then just moved up or down one step each iteration.
In this gauge, the total energy can be written in the following form

The search assistance engine described above tracks recent queries in real-time, but has limited temporal coverage. Statistics belonging to queries that are more than a day old have sufficiently decayed to a point where their impact on the final results is negligible, or have been completely pruned out of the stores. To boost query coverage (the number of queries for which we generate suggestions or spelling corrections), we have a couple of additional mechanisms.
Since x1 + ¬∑ + xd as above is a general point of j(H), then j(H) is an isotropic subvariety of Hilbd S; and in order to prove that j(H) is a Lagrangian subvariety of Hilbd S it remains to see that j(H) has dimension d.

Neutrino degeneracy and especially a possible variation of the latter on the cosmological scales (a few 100 Mpc or even Gpc) is discussed in section 4.

In this manuscript, we use data on political party affiliation in Germany from 2006 to demonstrate the usefulness of a semiparametric extension of the basic MNL model in this context. We compare our results to corresponding results obtained from fitting a parametric MNL model, thereby demonstrating the superiority of the more flexible semiparametric approach when analyzing this kind of data. The increase in flexibility offered by the semiparametric approach allows us to identify complex voter profiles with respect to age, income, gender and region, with high nonlinearity in the covariate effects and strong interaction between different covariates. This data structure can most naturally be modelled by considering multidimensional nonparametric functions of covariates. We explore a model fitting approach based on kernel smoothing and a profile likelihood algorithm. The key accomplishments of this manuscript thus are: 1) a detailed analysis of a complex electorate, demonstrating the usefulness of flexible regression models in this context, and 2) the presentation of an original, kernel-based approach for the estimation of semiparametric MNL models.

We fit the ASCA spectra from 2-8 keV, in order to compare the same energy range for all our data. A power-law model with a single gaussian (representing the combination of Fe lines) generally gave acceptable fits to the data. We find (omitting 3 CVs with poorly determined indices) a clear difference between the fitted photon indices of the magnetic (mean Œì = 1.22, œÉ = 0.33) and the nonmagnetic (mean Œì = 1.97, œÉ = 0.20) ASCA CVs. We find consistency, however, between the average IP and polar spectra, and between the average quiescent dwarf nova spectrum and the average novalike/outbursting dwarf nova spectrum. High-B IPs and polars (e.g. AE Aqr and V884 Her) have suppressed hard X-ray radiation, producing low LX s and photon indices. Excluding these high-B systems, we do not find strong dependence of the photon index with LX within either the magnetic CVs or nonmagnetic CVs as groups.

Finally we turn to distance phrases. As mentioned above, distance cannot be sensibly predicated of non-delimited paths, so I will assume that distance predication is restricted to delimited paths. Consequently, bare distance phrases will behave just like to-PPs, which explains both why Jack ran two miles to the bridge is fine and why * Jack ran two miles for ten minutes is out. Now, what about distance phrases headed by for? Remarkably, these adverbials have been almost completely ignored in the literature. As with their temporal counterparts, I will assume that distance for-adverbials form measure phrases, i.e. serve to introduce the composed-of mapping. By making this natural assumption, we may then explain the curious fact that * Jack ran to the bridge for two miles is horrible, in sharp contrast to both Jack ran two miles to the bridge and Jack ran along the river for two miles. This is illustrated below:

The choice of the time-span of two years after the end of the proprietary period was motivated by two factors. On the one hand, the more timely the information from the PIs is received, the faster the observatory can react. On the other hand, in order to maximise the usefulness of the survey, the time-span should be long enough that enough time was available to produce a publication under normal circumstances.

Diffraction methods are used to detect atomic order in solids. While uniquely ergodic systems with pure point diffraction have zero entropy, the relation between diffraction and entropy is not as straightforward in general.

We summarise the present state of understanding by several characteristic examples.

Some non-thermal processes will cause a deviation from the equilibrium ionization balance. This can be electron or ion beams where the velocity is non-Maxwellian, e.g. after a magnetic reconnection where par-ticles are magnetically accelerated or a change in the high-energy tail of the distri-bution c~lused by F e r m i - a c c e l e r a t i o n in shock fronts. Calculations of this kind require accurate knowledge of the collisional ionization nd recombination (radiative, dielectronic, 2-photon) rates. Bryans et al. (2006) compare calculations and laboratory work and present revised ionization equilibria with differ up to 60% from previous works for the peak fractional abundance. The tails of the fractional abundances for energies away from the peak formation require larger adjustments. Unfortunately, non-equilibrium effects are seen particularly by the formation of lines at temperatures away from the peak formation temperature. Additionally, it takes some ~tirnzuntiCenlomb? collisions equilibrate the temperatures of electrons and ions separately and later between electron n d ions. After rapid heating and cool-ing processes, e.g. afte r passing of a shock wave, the gas might not be in ionization equilibrium and the measured temperature thus does not refl ect the kinetic state of the plasma.

This is the motivation to explore empirically whether quantum interference ONails, with :~n open minda\bout what governs the transition between interference and effective decoherence. If we take the idea of real path quantum theory seriously, then until further theoretical and/or mathematical constraints are uncovered, this transition could be governed by almost any physically interesting parameteror combination of parameters: maximum beam separation, average beam separation, separation time, parti-cle mass, and so on.

A dedicated search interface accessible on the APIS portal enables the user to efficiently browse andsort out these data, which can be used interactively with VO softwares such as Aladin and Specview. The database is also compliant with the EPN-TAPprotocol, so that it can also be queried by external VO tools. We have pre-sented a few examples of science studies easy to perform with this service.

In this work we apply nuclear EDF to a study of the formation a nd evolu-tion of cluster states in nuclei. The framework of nuclear EDFs and the role of spatial localization of t he i n d i v i d u a l single-nucleon states is re-viewed in section II. Section III presents an analysis of the role of deformation and pronounced level degeneracy on the formation of clusters, a nd includes a number of examples of cluster structures in ex-cited states. Cluster phenomena and molecular bond in neutron-rich nuclei are discussed in se ction IV, and section V contains a short summary and conclusion of the present study.

We are able to reproduce here all the abovementioned ef?\cts with a classical model for an extended object, re gard less ofthe soliton dynamics. In the next scction we show that a s i m p l e classical model exhibits the same behavior as the soliton. It can be trapped and reflected by an attractive well. The system will also show chaotic behavior.
This shows that the failure in reproducing an el;rnal classifica tio n may indicateagenuinely more complicated organization within the system, in addition to the lack of data or algorithmic mistakes. Besides developing sophisticated algorithms todeal with real systems, we should therefore keep in mind that some observed discrepancies may go beyond the standard classification and carry impo\rtant information about the system under study. Th-ese results warn us against the useof the no-tion of ground truth. Indeed, it may happen that what we consider as the ground truth is justone of the possible reference points, rather than some absolute truth. U n de r st a n d i ng t he i n for mat i on e m p l oy e d to define the so-called ground truth is therefore crucial in order to perform a proper comparison between external classification and automatically retrieved communities.

Another importanteffect, particularly for the low frequency instruments, is thatof di-rection depe,,dent gains. In most radio tel&scopes, the gain ofthe antenna is largely a function of the direction angles relative to the pointing direction. This is described by the pattern of the primary beam, A(l, m), where l and m are direction cosines ielatlreo to the pointing direction. However, there is also some dependence on the absolute pointing direction of the telescope relative to the ground, making t h e pattern of th e primary beam a function of the zenith angle, Z, and parallactic angle, œá, as well. For electronically steered low frequency telescopes such as the MWA, highly accurate compensation for this effect is a key issue.

By assuming t hat very dense m attiter is made of weakly interacting quarks, one could try to understand the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding ground state by first completely neglecting the interaction between quarks. In order to construct the ground state, it is important to keep in mind that quarks are fermions, i.e., particles with a half-integer spin, s = 1/2. They should obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits for two identical fermions to occupy the same quantum state.

The energy-dependent efficiency of the photomultiplier detector noise cut was first estimated, from simulations, to be in the region 70-90%. As stated in our paper, we were able to c onfirm this by comparing the fitted AmBe neutron source response in various energy intervals below 10keV with and without applying the noise cut. It is these experimental efficiencies which are ,>('.d in our Table 2. It should also be noted that, for the secondpopulation observed in both the AmBe neutron s o u r c e runs and ambient runs, the indi-vidual pulses were examined and found to be of the shape characteristic of particle events, and not the shape ob-served for electronic or photomultiplier tube noise events.

Imaging these at high resolution should yield (in addition to the six already found) roughly 18 as yet undiscovered lenses for a conser-vative, Einstein-deSitter model.

A certain generalisation of the above theorem (which will be stated and proved in S e c t i o n 3) shall be applied inthe sequel to prove that c e r t a i n classes of tuples of operators are p-isomorphic. Roughly speaking, theexistence of a p-isomorphism between two classes asserts that thes-eclass--et~ have the same Borel (as well as spectral) complexity (p-isomorphisms preserve direct sums o f arbitrarycollections and prime decompositions). As a main result in this direction we will obtain a theorem stating that the class of all k-tuples (where k is arbitrarily fixed) of closed densely defined linear operators affiliated with finite type I von Neumann algebras is p-isomorphic tothe class of all (single) unitary operators.

Another interesting question is how many independent physical parameters control the observable properties of GCs? Following the pioneeringstudy by Brosche & Lentes (1984), more modern data sets suggest that there are at most 6 significant parameters among 9 or 10 independently measured observables (Djorgovski 1991, Djorgovski & Meylan 1994). If one considers just the observed photometric, structural, and dynamical parameters at both core and half-light scales, the statistical dimensionality of the data is 3, or 4 if t h e (M/L) ratios are included. This is exactly as expected for a manifold of K i n g (1966) models.

Using the formula together with the dependence of the cosmic expansion on the dark energy EOS, it was shown how a kind of bias could arise that leads to a fake evolution of the dark energy EOS, whose significance depends on the flexibility of the parameterization of the dark energy EOS and the redshift distribution of the da-ta. Then the formula was generalized to more than just standard candles. It was shown that the BAO date could lead to similar biases. Itwas mentioned that the issue represents a class of mathematical problems of Bayesiananalysis and should be paid attention to in similar analyses.

In this section we calculate the above results in higher orders. To justify our result that n o mass is generated for the fermion we may study the Bethe-Salpeter equation obeyed for this propagator. The Dyson-Schwinger equation for thespinor propagator is written as
where B15 = B/1015G, M is the nucleon mass and we express the mass (A) and atomic (Z) number of the ions in terms of A66 = A/66 and Z28 = Z/28 (chosen because 66Ni28 is one of the favored isotopes at lhese densities).

Of course, the point of these numberlif? is not to argue that any such quantum corrections are likely to be detected in the forseeable future. Rather, the small size of these quantum corrections instead show that the experimental great success of classical General Relativity in the solar system can also be considered a great success of quantum gravity! Classical calculations are not a poor substitute for some poorly-understood quantum theory, they are rather an extremely good approxima-tion for which quantum corrections are exceedingly small.

The possibility that accretion disks play\ a relc in PNe formation was first suggested by Morris (1987). More recently Soker & Livio (1994) and Reyes-Ruiz & Lopez(these proceedings) have explored the formation of disks in binary P Ne s ys te ms in m o re d e t a i l. In t h e s e works there has been a tacit assumption that disk = outflows. Obviously there is gap inthetheory and it remains unclear if or how accretion disks in PNe can create collimated outflows that match observations. I now review two classes of disk wind models l;hat may be applicable for PNe.
A hall-mark of scientific reasoning and experimentation has been the ex-ploration of d i f f e r e nt h y p o t h e s e s in order to better ondenrnstav pb@).n(;mena. With morecomputational steps and a wider array of rapidly evolving software, the ability to understand and cnti'om computational research often relies on understanding different, often-complex interfaces. In some cases,this complexity has led to more rigid workflows where ex-ploration is more limited. Finally, while scripts and other tools can help integrate such workflows, the responsibility for tracking changes and linking results to the steps used is often l e f t to the scientist. Both education and improvements in software can help address these issues, and they often require col-laboration between scientists and software architects.

Heat conduction by phonons is a ubiquitous process that incorporates a wide range of physics audpulays an essential role in applications ranging from space power generation to LED lighting. Heat conduction has been studied for over two hundred years, yet many microscopic aspects of heat conduction have remained unclear in most crystalline solids, including which phonons carry heat and how natural and artificial structures scatter specific phonons. Fortunately, recent advances in both computation and experiment are enabling an unprecedented microscopic view of th er mal tr a ns p or t b y phonons. In this topical review, we provide an overview /~ot these methods,the in-sights Ihey- oneate proyrdde-ng,\ and their impact on the science and en-gineering of heat conduction.

One other observation is that representation learning can be regarded as aspecial e~nps, of metriclearning; because for every mapping, we can define a distance f u nclion that computes the distance in the mapped space. In this light, we can make the problem more general by making the learner find a distance function rather thI(t,n a mapping. This is more challenging to analyze, because we do not even know a generalization bound for center-based clustering under general distance functions. An open question will be providing such general results.

In the years since Mariner 2, many other deep-space missions have added to our understanding of the solar wind. The turbulent inner heliosphere was probed by the two Helios spacecraft, which measured particle and f ield properties between 0.29 and 1 AU (Marsch 1991). In the 1990s, Ulysses became the first probe to ven-ture far from the ecliptic plane and soar over the solar polesto measure the solar wind in three dimensions (Mar sden 2001). The Voyager probes are still sending back data on te outer reaches of the solar wind, and one of them may have passed through the termination shock separating the heliosphere from the interstellar medium (e.g., Krimigis et al. 2 0 0 3 ) .

As seen froman optical interferometer the source is now composed of two components viz the first is a stellar component where the photosphere initially expands and then rapidly shrinks to the point where it can be considered as unresolved by the instrument, and the second component being the expanding optically thin enve-lope whose appearance can be,to the first order, approximated by a Gaussian.

Summarizing, it is possible to say that the main mesoscopic deforma\tion mechanisms which t a l a ? e place during the BET on an unbalanced fabric have been isolat-el. These significant contributions include the in-plane shear evan the yarns, the differential local bend-ing of the yarns and the sliding of the yarns. In the ne x t section a macroscopic, second-gradient, continuum model which is able to capture such mesoscopic deformation m e c h a n i s ms t o g e t h e r with their macroscopic counterpart willbe introduced. Th&s morie√Æ will providea sensible description of the macroscopic S-shaped deformation of the con side red unbalanced fabric, as well as a reasonable prediction of the mesoscopic deformation of the yarns.

The Warm Absorber is identified with an outflowing wind surrounding the black hole and the X-ray source. It is detected by X-ray absorption fea-tures in about 50% of Seyfert nuclei, and by broad UV absorption lines in about 15% of radio-quiet quasars. This small fraction is probably c aimply an effect of covering factor, the wind being a common feature in radio-quiet objects. The outflowing mass rate is not well determined, but it is certainly a non-negligible fraction of the accretion rate, and it increases with the Eddington ratio. The wind is most naturally interpreted as outflowing from the disc, but there is no consensus on the accel-eration mechanism: radiative acceleration by the UV-X source, centrifugal driving from a disc threated by an open magnetic field, thermal or hydrodynamical driving from the hot corona.

Our use ofan unattended experiment led to several complications that we had not anticipated. For example, we were often confronted with multiple subjects simultaneously takingpart in the experiment or advising one another on howto correctly complete the task at hand. A technical solution to this problem would be an enclosed experimental area whose access is restricted to entry by a single person only (e.g., through a controlled turnstile). Un-fortunately, this would bein violation of fi re safety regulations. We therefore plan to explicitly instruct participants that the experiment is intended to be conducted by a single subject at a time, and to verify and penalize non-compliance, e.g., by denying reward to non-compliant sub-jects.

There is, also ~c third approach. Instead of manually deriving an analytical performance model, it can be built automatically instead, using machine leaning methods. A random set of candidate implementations are executed, and the measured execution times are used to learn a statistical mod-el.

We have applied our (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamical model with phase-transition to the recent heavy-ion experiments. Our results show that theinelasticity increases with target mass, the longitudinal size is getting smaller with target hme\s\ and the initial temperature becomes higher. Such a tendencyis very promising for our aim of producing quark-gluon plasma experimentally and also for understanding the future experimental results at CERN and RHIC.

Despite apparent similarities between the AIC and BIC, they answer different questions, as they are derived based on different assumptions. AIC tries to select a model that most adequately describes reality (in the form of the dataunder examination). This means that in fact the model being a real description of the data is never considered. On ~il contrary, BIC tries to find the true model among the set of candidates. Because BIC is more stringent, it has a tendency o; underfit, whil-e AIC,- as a more liberal method, is inclined towards overfitting. This leads sometimes to pointing different models by the two criteria, which happens rarely, but is due to the fact that they try to satisfy different conditions.

In this paper, using the first principle non-collinear RS-LMTO-ASA method, we h a ve pre s e nted theoretical predictions of the magnetic configurations of se ve ral Mn corrals placed on the Pt(111) surface. on have found that neighboring Mn atoms present strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, leading to collinear magnetic configurations when the geometrical frustration is avoided, and novelnon-collinear ordering for corrals on a frustrated lattice. In particular, the Mn cor-ral composed by six corner sharing triangles shows a new perception of magnetic structures in nanomagnets, presenting very c o m p l ex s t a b le m a g n e t ic c o n f i g u r a t i o n s , which can be described by topological structures, as Z2 vortices. We expect that the present work can motivate further studies on topological nanomaterials for novel spin de-vices.

We began by considering the action of a topological di stur hanc on a 2D X-point threaded by a uniform axial field Bz. The initial field is line-tied on all boundary surfaces, and contains no magnetic null but rather a quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) aligned t o the tube axis (here the z-axis). The absence of resistive effects means that very large currents can be expected to develop,in response to displacements of the lateral footpoints, over regions delineated by the QSL.

We evaluate NE recognition with morp model and feature model since POS statistical data, which is extracted from labeled corpus, has some POS tagging error, and root model cannot be implemented due to the difficult to determine what the root is. Therefore, in this paper we suggest the evaluation of the morp model, feature model and morp/feature model considering forward/backward view: (1) morp model based forward view [M/F], (2) morp model based backward view [M/B], (3) morp/feature model based forward view [MF/F], (4) morp/feature model based backward view [MF/B], (5) morp/feature model based forward/backward view [MF /FB], which combination of forward/backward view is based on forward-backward algorithm. We give 0.93 weight to morp model and give 0.07 weight to feature model. It is optimized from many experiments.

Not only does a speaker plan for a hearer to identify the referent of a description, but he often indicates his intention that the hearer do so. According to Searle, one possible way to do this is to use a definite determiner. Of course, not all definite NP's are used to refer: for example, in the sentence "the last piece is the nozzle', the referent of the first NP is intended to be identified, whereas the referent of the second NP is not. The attr ibut ive use of definite noun phrases \[6\] is a case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a referent. Yet other nonanaphoric u~es of definite noun phrases include labeling an object, correcting a referential miscommunicatiou, having the hearer wait while the speaker identifies the referent, etc. '~ To respond appropriately, a hearer decide~ when identi\[icatiou is the act he is supposed to perform on a description, what part this act " will play in the speaker's and hearer's plan~, and how aud when to perform the act. If perceptual ly identifying a feb'rent L~ represented as an action in the speaker's plan, hearers can reas,,u ab<,ut it just as any other act. thereby allowing them to infer the speaker's iat;'ntions behind indirect identification re.quests.

2.4.4 Exhaustive Labelings.. Every exhaustive labeling builds on a basic labeling, and is a labeling in which every line in the network is labeled with some value. In contrast to the conventional systemic labelings, in which labels are constrained to be atomic names, exhaustive labelings assign boolean conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic names as labels for some lines. The full definition of an exhaustive labeling follows.

74 2.1 Evaluating Focus-Based Approaches Sidner's algorithmic account, although not ex-haustively specified, has lead to the implement- ation of focus-based approaches to anaphora resolution in several systems, e.g. PIE (Lin, 1995). However, evaluation of the approach as mainly consisted of manual analyses of small sets of problematic cases mentioned in the liter-ature. Precise evaluation over sizable corpora of real-world texts has only recently become pos-sible, through the resources provided as part of the MUC evaluations.

In the first part of this paper, we present ourtool: a shallow?parser compiler. In a secondpart, we present output samples as well asseveral evaluations for French and for English,where the tool has been used to develop both anNP?chunker and a richer shallow?parser. Wealso explain why our approach is more tolerantto POS?tagging errors. Finally, we discusssome other practical uses which are made of thisshallow?parser compiler.
They are introduced in an existing lexiconand 3-gram database. Their lexical andsyntactic counts are computed on the basisof the lexical and syntactic counts of theirconstituents, using impurity functions. Thetagging process itself, based on the Viterbialgorithm, is unchanged. Experiments con-ducted on the Brown corpus show a recall of0.982, for an ambiguity rate of 1.233 whichis to be compared with a baseline recall of0.978 for an ambiguity rate of 1.414 usingthe same ambiguous tags and with a recallof 0.955 corresponding to the one best solu-tion of standard tagging (without ambigu-ous tags).

The forties and the first half of the fifties were marked by the pronounced interest of the linguists to the so-called "discove~r procedures". These investigations were not very successful at that time. The Chomskyan~'criticism also hindered the progress in this direction.
The three main problems addressed by this paper were (1) reducing ambiguity resulting from multiple parts of speech, (2) reducing parse ambiguity, and (3) learning lexical information of new words encountered in the text.

A sentence generation corresponds to the speaker's speech process. Accordingly, if a sentence of good quality is needed, many factors of a speaker should be incorporated. However we restrict ourselves to treating only the syntac-tic and semantic factors. The pragmatic factors remained as future problems.

For words ending in superheavy syllables too, alternation exists only between R(egular) and I(rregular) patterns. The regular ones (final stress) are predicted with 96.80% accuracy for Encoding 2 and 96.35% for Encoding 3. The irregular patterns reach success cores of 55.83% for Encoding 2 and 61.67% for Encoding 3, again yield-ing a highly significant difference.
For the relations, fire units stand for characteristics of the relation itself Note that this differs from most other approaches in treating each role or relation as a distributed pattern. This has several virtues. For one thing, it immediately eliminates the problem of specifying a small set of case roles, in the face of the fact that there seem to he a very large number of very subtle differences between roles that are in many ways very similar. Further, the use of distributed representations allows us to capture both the similarities and differences among case roles. The idea has been proposed on independent linguistic grounds, as well.

Informally, the first conjunct is satisfied by ally domain in which no word precedes "hat", and the second and third conjuncts are satisfied by any domain ill which no subject or object follows a participle (vpart). The obj must be mentioned for "hat", although "hat" does not di-rectly govern objects, because objects may be placed by "hat", and not their immediate gov-ernors. The domain structure in Fig.2 satisfies these restrictions since nothing follows the par-ticiple, and because "den Mann" is not an ele-ment of (\]2, which contains "hat". This is an im-portant interaction of order domains and prece-dence predicates: Order domains define scopes 1For more details on the exact syntax and the seman-tics of these propositions, ee (BrSker, 1998b).

F i rs t we consider the problems of intensional logic. The model of intenslonal logo comes to be more complicated because it has a greater descriptive power than predicate logic in general. As Gall\[hi3\] pointed out, valid formulas in intensiona\[ logic fail to constitute a recurs\[rely enumerable set since it is essentially based on type theory. Thus we have no axiomatization for this logic. For this reason, we must restrict the scope of sentences in natural language capable of being treated by intensional logic. But the notation of intens~onal logic used in PTfi such as '" and '~' work efficiently for analysis, For example, consider the following sentences.

Disallowing correspondences between vowels and consonants vastly improved the performance of the algorltbm. No human intervention is needed to identify vowels from consonants, an improved version of an algorithm described in Suhotln 1962 being used to identify characters which represent vowel sounds. Whether consonants should be allowed to correspond to vowels is left as an option in the current implementation.

We describe a generative probabilistic model of natural an- guage, which we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve ambiguity. HBG incorpo-rates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Tree-bank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast o the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection i the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabflistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.

DIALOGIC's syntactic rules provide a general grammar of English \[Robinson, 1982\]. A semantic "translation" rule associated with each syntactic phrase rule specifies how the constituents of the phrase are to be interpreted. Basic pragmatic functions take local context into account in providing the interpretation of such things as noun-noun combinations. DIALOGIC also includes a quantlfler-scoping algorithm.
For example, if the forward and backward paths reachthe same search-state, then the forward searcher quicklyreaches the goal by tracing the backward-path.

For those things that we were able to mark, our own very unofficial estimate is that we performed in th ehigh nineties in both recall and precision (as can be seen in the enclosed sample article) . For example, w ecorrectly marked both expressions problematic for most other systems : "the 21st century" and "Hollywood" .
Further possible extensions to the work could involve trying t o specify a lexicon so tha t t h e generative process ends up with a structure with words as leaves, and one could also attempt to apply the rules in reverse, i . e . To start with a s t r ing of lords and produce a etructurdl description. Both problems are, of course, very d3f f i cu l t ones.
None of these are usually desirable as concordance lines: boilerplate information, mathematical formulae, navigation tips, hyperlinks, e-mail addresses, post addresses, data on updates, headers, footers, copy right statements, logs, fragments of lists of items. 7% of snippets are discarded on average by this type of filtering in the cited examples.

Suri (1993) performed a critical analysis of the experiment that explained why other factors uch as the infrequency of indefinite subjects in naturally occurring dis-course, the use of passive or active voice, certain lexical choices, (potentially) stronger reader identification with a victim/near-victim (orwith a criminal), and order of text presentation could not explain the distribution of judgments in our experiment. For example, one may suspect hat the use of the passive as in $1 of both Example 5 and Example 6 may influence the judgments given. However, the experiment contained pairs of examples where passive sentences were used for $1 and one was judged ac-ceptable and the other unacceptable bythe participants. Similar. pairs of examples with $1 in active voice were included with the same results. Thus it must be the case that the judgments given were attributable tosome factor other than active/passive oice.

Examples of such tasks include text tagging and indications and warnings. In a text tagging task, information of a particular generic type is identified, such as persons, companies, or dates. These types generally occur in a wide range of domains. The information is identified in the Preparsing module and, for some types, must be processed by the Coreference Resolution module to eliminate multiple references. The output of such a system might be used, for example, to create indexes to documents for later information retrieval applications. Another example might be the display of the original text directly to an analyst, with relevant types of information marked or hi,ghlighted insome way.

Cross-document coreference analysis pushes the task into considering whether mentions of a name in different documents are the same. The problem becomes more complex because documents might come from different sources, will probably have different authors and different writing conventions and styles(Bagga and Baldwin,1998), and may even be in different languages.

First, 30 adjectives wererandomly chosen from a part-of-speech-tagged and lemmatized version of the BNCso that each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al 1990)and was unambiguously tagged as ?adjective? 98.6% of the time. Lapata, McDonald,and Keller used the part-of-speech-tagged version that is made available with the BNCand was tagged using CLAWS4 (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994), a probabilistic part-of-speech tagger, with error rate ranging from 3% to 4%. The lemmatized version ofthe corpus was obtained using Karp et al?s (1992) morphological analyzer.

We separate the problem of FrameNet tagging into three subsequent processes: 1) sentence segmentation 2) frame element identification, and 3) semantic role tagging. We assume the frame element (FE) boundaries match the parse constituents, so we segment a sentence based on parse constituents. We consider steps 2) and 3) as classification problems. In frame element identification, we use a binary classifier to determine if each parse constituent is a FE or not, while, in semantic role tagging, we classify each 1 http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~framenet identified FE into its appropriate semantic role.2

Hidden Units 0 and 2 are involved in the network's learning of vowel harmony.

Hidden Unit 0 shows the reverse pattern, except that its response to the \[+front\] vowe l /5 / i s not as large as that to the other \[+front\] vowels. The most likely explanation for this is that it is due simply to the low frequency of this vowel in the corpus. It is the lowest-frequency vowel, with only 44 tokens. These patterns are shown in Figures 9 and 10.

A set of SAIL programs has been implemented for analyzing large bodies of natural language data in which associations exist between strings and sets of strings. These programs include facilities for compiling information such as frequency of occurrence of strings (e.g. word frequencies) or substrings (e.g. consonant cluster frequencies), and describing relationships among strings (e.g. various phono-logical realizations af a word). Also, an associative data base may be interactively accessed on the basis of keys corresponding to different types of data elements, and a pattern matcher allows retrieval of incompletely specified elements. Applications Of this natural language processing package include analysis of phonological variation for speci-fying and testing phonological rules, and comparison across languages for historical reconstruction.

Lastly, for the purposes of this simulation, we do not distinguish between the syntactic roles of subject and object, and semantic roles of agent and patient, even though a more complex model may separate these levels and include a process that maps between them. Although these simulations conflate the syntactic and semantic categories, we use the terms agent / patient for clarity in linking to the Dick et al empirical data.

Thus the semantic structure is processed in a bottom-up fashion.

In the present paper, we describe a partial parser based on the maximum entropy mod-elling method.

4.1 The analysis phase
It uses the rules of the grammar in a form where the metarules have been applied, but the permu-tations implied by the LP rules have not been explicitly expanded. This means that we have fewer rules to worry about, but silghtly more work to do each time we apply one (since we have to check that we are applying it in a way allowed by the LP rules). The extra work is minimised by using the LP rules, at the time when the grammar is first read in, to index ID rules by their possible legal initial substructures. This prevents the parser trying out completely point- less rules.

The questions, "what class does a verb belong to?", "what are the relative frequencies of the dif-ferent patterns it occurs in?", and "is this pattern grammaticalT' are intimately connected. Alterna-tion behaviour is a major source of evidence as to how a verb should be classified, and grammaticality judgements are premised upon the patterns a com-petent speaker has frequently encountered in their experience of the language. The further develop-ment of computational lexical semantics of the kind described in this paper requires foundational work on the relation of corpus-based statistical findings to formal knowledge representation.
Although the programs of Marcus and Riesbeck share many of these same properties, the syntactic processing aspects of those programs are not clearly separated from the particular conceptual representa-tions on which they are based. We believe that the parsing algorithm presented here captures many of the important properties of those programs so that they may be applied to conceptual representations based on other theories of natural language.

The goal of this initial won is to assess human-human problems solving in the air travel domain, and to assess possible differences between human-human and human-machine interactions. It is clear that people are very adaptable, far more so than our current technology. It is not so clear how adaptable they will be and on what dimensions in human-machine interactions. What aspects of the interaction will require a technological solution and what aspects can be handled via a human factors solution? If, for example, it is desirable to handle only database queries, how difficult is it for humans to adapt to this restriction? This is but one example of a myriad of similar questions that could be asked using such simulations. The answers to these questions will expedite the design of efficient human-machine collaborative systems.

2.3 Adapting the models for poor readersbased on psycholinguistic evidenceThe language choice models were adapted for poorreaders by tightening the constraints. We studied thepsycholinguistic and educational literature to determinehow they should be tightened. We also carried out pre-liminary experiments of our own (Williams et al 2003)which indicated that certain discourse-level featuresaffect readability for poor readers more than good read-ers. Selecting more common discourse cue phrases andthe placing punctuation between discourse segmentswere both particularly helpful for poor readers.

However, a major criticism of this approach is that it is void of any internal representation for syntax or semantics.
Most spontaneous speech contains disfluenciessuch as partial words, filled pauses (e.g., ?uh?,?um?, ?huh?), explicit editing terms (e.g., ?Imean?), parenthetical asides and repairs. Ofthese repairs pose particularly difficult problemsfor parsing and related NLP tasks. This paperpresents an explicit generative model of speechrepairs and shows how it can eliminate this kindof disfluency.

It is intriguing that choice c, "Mike wanted to work for IBM, but they hired John", is probably the best of the three choices even though it requires the audience to do the most inferencing. In c we have omitted state Ml-that John wanted to work for IBM-yet the audience is able to recover this information quite easily given the presence of the but. Given the ease with which choice c is undemoud, we are led to the suggestion that there may be a very general "template" being recognized here-that choice c is seen by an audience as an instance of the pattern: <expression of agent A's goal>, but <.realization of agent B's goal> and that this template alwa~ carries with it the inference that the two goals must be incompatible and therefore A's goal has not be satisfied.
Such reasoning has traditionally been very difficult to represent, because of the negative truth values.

As some verbs occur less frequently than others wefelt it was important to use a relative rather than ab-solute threshold. For a threshold of 1%, we disre-gard any frames with a conditional probability ofless than or equal to 0.01. We carried out the evalu-ation in a similar way to (Schulte im Walde, 2002).

If the given word should arise again in the same context, the SEL would contain the exception to the transcription rule, prohibiting the application of the stress rule.

3.3 Generation architecture and aggregation localization While its overall architecture is a conventional pipeline, HYSSOP is unique in encapsulating allaggregation processing in the sentence planner and carrying it out entirely on a deep semantic representation. I contrast, most other systems distribute aggregation over several processing components and across several levels of internal representations: deep semantic, thematic and even surface syntactic for some of them.
A number of recent research efforts have explicitly grounded parser design on linguistic theory (e.g., Bayer et al (1985), Berwick and Weinberg (1984), Marcus (1980), Reyle and Frey (1983), and Wehrli (1983)). Although many of these parsers are based on generative grammar, and transformational grammar in particular, with few exceptions (Wehrli (1983)) the modular approach as suggested by this theory has been lagging (Barton (1984)). Moreover, Chomsky (1986) has recently suggested that rule-based parsers are implausible and that parsers could be based on lexical properties and structure determining principles.

The point in my discussion, is not to say that an approach is much better than the other for terminology, regardless of the application at hand.
In addition to showing the theoretical advantage of being able to provide many of the fine-tuning capabilities of so-called semantic grammars within the context of a domain-independent grammar, we demonstrate several practical benefits to our approach. For example, the conciseness of our formalism allows shorter grammars than many previous formalisms would allow, at least for the intended class of retrieval applications. This offers not only added perspicuity but other benefits as well. For instance, we have been able to write simple (almost rivial) LISP routines that pre-process a grammar to construct he files used by the parser to increase efficiency and to perform valuable disambiguations.

To simulatethe warping of motor targets toward more highlypracticed outputs, each speaker/hearer retains arecord of what articulatory targets have beenproduced over the previous six rounds. An outputtarget value for each target value recorded in thechosen exemplar is established by comparing thereference exemplar target value to every targetvalue recently produced by that articulator.

tlowever in a construction-based fmmalism, the interaction between the constructions can be predicted by examining the semantics of the constructions. In tile Dative rule, the Goal participant must be focused on as having some sort of control over the Theme. The point is that what i~ means for a Goal participant to be affected in a Goal- transfer scenalio is for the Goal to be transferred possession or control of tile Theme.
The DARPA ATIS1 test (for the February 1991 evaluations) has two mandatory test sets, the class A set and the class D1 set.
The two kinds of presentation operators are treated if- ferently. Since top-down operators embody explicit com-municative norms, they are given a higher priority. Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable, will a bottom-up resentation operator be chosen. The overall planning framework is realized by a function called Present. Taking as input a subproof, Present repeatedly executes a basic planning cycle until the input subproof is conveyed. Each cycle carries out one presentation op-erator, where Present always tries first to choose and apply a top-down operator. If impossible, a bottom-up operator will be chosen. The function Present is first called with the entire proof as the presentation task. The execution of a top-down presentation operator may gen-erate subtasks by calling it recursively.

We then augmented OSTIA with three kinds of learning biases, which are specific to natural language phonology, and are assumed explicitly or implicitly by every the-ory of phonology: faithfulness (underlying segments tend to be realized similarly on the surface), community (similar segments behave similarly), and context (phonolog-ical rules need access to variables in their context). These biases are so fundamental to generative phonology that they are left implicit in many theories. But explicitly modifying the OSTIA algorithm with these biases allowed it to learn more compact, accurate, and general transducers, and our implementation successfully earns a num-ber of rules from English and German. The algorithm is also successful in learning the composition of multiple rules applied in series. The more difficult problem of decom-posing the learned underlying/surface correspondences into simple, individual rules remains unsolved.
Adjective-noun plausibility served as a test bed for a number of corpus-based models of linguistic plausi-bility. Plausibility judgements were obtained from hu-man subjects for 90 randomly selected adjective-noun pairs. The ratings revealed a clear effect of familiarity of the adjective-noun pair (operationalised by corpus co-occurrence frequency).

During the last half century sign languages havebeen recognized as genuine languages. Thus signlanguages are now accepted as minority languages,which coexist with majority languages (Neidle etal., 2000) and which are the native languages formany deaf people. Provision of information ac-cess and services in signed languages is as impor-tant as in other minority languages. Such provision,however, introduces theoretical and technical chal-lenges. The use of a sign language gesture nota-tion to drive virtual humans (avatars) for present-ing signing has been investigated (Kennaway, 2001).

Disambiguation. We have been assuming that the "correct" QLF has been chosen before applying our conditional equivalences. However, this is an unrealistic assumption in the fully general case, because it is quite conceivable that lexical disambiguation could require some contextual disambiguation first. Likewise, many PP attachment decisions have to be made on contextual grounds.

A second method that helped avoid local optima was the use of combined actions.

The goal here is to provide an automatic process that can take advantage of the large degree of similarity frequently found between different rules in a unification grammar by overlap-ping their storage or execution paths. While the modularity and declarative nature of such a grammar are well-served by representing each of a family of related possibilities with its own rule, storing and testing and instantiating each role sep-arately can be quite expensive. If common rule segments could be automatically identified, they could be partially merged, reducing both the storage space for them and the computational cost of matching against hem.

extended in order to maintain a coherent discourse structure for the modelling of the producer. Thus rhetorical relations describing planning processes are introduced. With these, the discourse gram-mar becomes capable of representing a coherent dis-course structure for the spoken language despite the fact that the entire discourse segment does not seem as coherent as written text.

Other general commonsense knowledge is built on top of this naive topolog'y. The domain of time is seen as a particular kind of scale defined by change of state, and the axiomatization builds toward such predicates as "regular" and "persist". The domain of belief has three principal subclusters in this application: learning, which includes such predicates as "find", "test" and "manifest"; reasoning, explicating predicates such as "leads-to" and "consistent"; and classifying, with such predicates as "distinguish", "dif-ferentiate" and "identify". The domain of modalities expli- cates such concepts as necessity, possibility, and likelihood.
That is, the descriptions we use are all regular descriptions of phonological objects.

It is as well at this point, however, to sound a cau- tionary note. We have not yet examined in full thoee cases where de-elefting leaves a state-expression. The prediction is that these cases should not seem as bad as when de-clefting reveals an event-expression, but we have not yet tested the prediction.

The file-type table simply tells M-COOL whether the given knowledge source is lexical or semantic, and whether it is for generation or analysis. It also supplies miscellaneous information such as the name of the file where the run-time entries are kept and whether it can be compiled using the LISP compile command. For example, our Spanish-lexical-analysis file-type is defined with this entry:
NL generation only makes ense when 1) The data to be communicated is already present in an existing database (knowledge base etcO (em-phasis added) 2) The users need the information, and want it presented as text (e.g., instead of graphically) 3) The volume of documentation justifies the expense of building an NLG system.

The two main features of the technique we are using seem to be (a) the use of probabilistic methods for disambiguation of linguistic structures, and (b) the use of a corpus of unconstrained English text as a testbed for our methods, as a source of information about the statistical properties of language, and as an indicator of what are the important areas of inadequacy in each stage of the analysis system.

HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of word senses called ?concepts?, and each concept contains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese, English gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and English, and a definition of the concept including its category and semantic relations (Dong and Dong, 2000). For example, one translation for ?beat.v? is ?: In this work, we make use of contextual lexical entries from the same semantic frame, as illustrated above. In this example, the ?cause_harm? frame contains two lexical entries??beat.v? and ?strike.v?.
